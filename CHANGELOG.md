## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 9fa71cb: Replace the original single-file “Fix Namespace” command with the “Fix Namespaces in…” command that triggers a quick picker so users can choose to fix the active file, its directory tree, the containing project, or any solution, sweeping every selected scope’s files in one run.
